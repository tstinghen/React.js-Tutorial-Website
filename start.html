This is a tutorial of some of the basic concepts of the React.js library.
<br/><br/>
React is a joint effort between Facebook and Instagram, and was released for public use in May 2013. React takes a different approach to scripting by focusing on breaking tasks down into small subtasks called  "components." 
<br/><br/>
Components may look familiar to people familiar with functional programming, because they work like functions in C++ and methods in Java. 
<br/><br/>
Components are put together to make apps that are responsive to user input, while maintaining immutable state (meaning that an object's state is not modified after it's creation). Immutable state is valuable, because when object's states are changed in many different places in an app, users may find themselves in a state that the creator did not intend, which can lead to errors and bugs, many of which can be hard to re-create. Immutable state leads to predictable behavior, and errors that can be recreated, and corrected much more easily. 
<br/><br/>
React can be used in three different ways: 
<ul>
<li>It can be used as just the UI (user interface) and can be integrated into an existing project without making changes to the rest of the project. 
</li><li>It can be used as a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) for representing and interacting with objects on a web-page. React mixes markup (such as HTML) with javascript, in a way that is unconventional, but React's website says to, "Give it 5 minutes," and their "crazy" ideas should start to 
make a lot of sense. 
</li><li>it can be used as a one way, reactive data flow, to take data from the user and send it to the server.
</ul> 
In this tutorial we will be focusing on React as a user interface and virtual DOM.

Where can you see React in action? 
<br/><br/> 
Facebook and Instagram are both based in React. When you comment on a picture or Like a status, and you can see that comment, or that Like instantaneously, without reloading the page, that's React! 
<br/><br/> 
Once you go through this tutorial, try keeping an eye out, and see if you can recognize React functionality on those two sites. I think you'll be surprised at how many different ways Instagram and Facebook are finding to use React in their user interaction. 
<br/><br/>
This tutorial will walk you through the process of creating a responsive to-do list application, utilizing React to handle the entire process, including the UI. Of course, such a small project will not accurately represent the scope of what React's virtual DOM can accomplish, but it should  hopefully give you an initial understanding of React's new, convention-challenging approach, and let you start imagining what React's virtual DOM could do for your project. 
<br/><br/>
Let's get started!
